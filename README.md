👋 Hi, I’m @Szafranerio

  
🧐 As a double master's degree student at Aalborg University and the Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing, specializing in Innovation Management, I am deeply immersed in the symbiotic relationship between data and innovation. I firmly believe that the convergence of these two realms is pivotal for fostering open innovation and unlocking substantial organizational benefits. At the heart of this synergy lies the concept of absorptive capacity—the aptitude to not only recognize the value of data but also to effectively leverage it for commercialization. This transformative ability allows organizations to absorb, assimilate, and apply external knowledge, propelling them towards innovation-driven growth.
Personally, I am fervently passionate about the transformative power of data analysis. I firmly hold the conviction that robust data analysis has the potential to revolutionize every facet of the market landscape, propelling existing industries forward and catalyzing the creation of entirely new markets. By meticulously dissecting data, uncovering hidden patterns, and deriving actionable insights, we can navigate complex market dynamics with precision, foresight, and ingenuity.


😎 As my primary tool for data analysis, I wield Python, particularly leveraging Jupyter, and its associated libraries. I possess a strong proficiency in Excel and am actively honing my skills in VBA programming For visualization purposes, I have chosen to harness the capabilities of Tableau. Furthermore, I have cultivated a solid foundation in database management, with PostgreSQL serving as a trusted ally in storing, querying, and managing data. 

📚 Continuous improvement is key, and my focus for the next phase includes delving deeper into Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NonSQL databases, and further mastering Python


Do not hesitate to contact me, I am always willing to help or answers any questions.

👋 Hi, I’m @Szafranerio

🧐 As a double master's student in Innovation Management at Aalborg University and the Chinese Academy of Science, I'm deeply immersed in the symbiotic relationship between data and innovation. I believe their convergence is vital for fostering open innovation and unlocking significant organizational benefits. Absorptive capacity, the ability to recognize and leverage data for commercialization, lies at the core of this synergy, enabling organizations to absorb, assimilate, and apply external knowledge for innovation-driven growth.

😎 I'm passionate about the transformative power of data analysis, believing it can revolutionize markets, propelling existing industries forward and creating new ones. Leveraging Python, particularly Jupyter and associated libraries, alongside Excel and VBA programming, I dissect data to uncover hidden patterns and derive actionable insights. I utilize Tableau for visualization and PostgreSQL for robust database management, ensuring precision, foresight, and ingenuity in navigating complex market dynamics.

📚 Continuous improvement is key, and my focus for the next phase includes delving deeper into Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NoSQL databases, and further mastering Python

Do not hesitate to contact me, I am always willing to help or answer any questions.
